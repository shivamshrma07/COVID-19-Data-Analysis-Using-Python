# COVID-19-Data-Analysis-Using-Python
## This project was the part of the Guided Project under Coursera.
You need to have the dataset related to the COVID-19 stats published by John Hopkins University, and another dataset consist of various life factors, scored by the people living in each country around the globe.(both available in the repository)
We are going to merge these two datasets to see if there is any relationship between the spread of the the virus in a country and how happy people are, living in that country. 
### Various steps include : 
* Importing COVID19 dataset.
* Finding a good measure. Decide and calculate a good measure for our analysis.
* Importing World happiness report dataset.
* Visualizing the results. Visualize our results using Seaborn.
